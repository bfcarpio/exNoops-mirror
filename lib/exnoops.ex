defmodule Exnoops do
  @moduledoc """
  Elixir API wrapper around [Github's Noops](https://noopschallenge.com/)

  **Note:** This wrapper was made for educational purposes; ie learning elixir and making libraries with it. This libraries probably isn't of the quality that you'd want for production use.

  Pull requests welcome as long as they contain explanations as to why something should be changed (once again, to faciltate learning)

  Each noop is represented by a module and each endpoint is represented by a function.
